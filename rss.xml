            <title><![CDATA[Johann Matthias Sperger was born on 23 March 1750 in Feldsberg (now Vlatice). Little is known about his early musical education, but it is possible that he received instruction on the organ and sang in one of the choirs at the school he attended. Although there is no definite date for his arrival in Vienna, Meier states that he probably moved there in 1767 and took theory lessons with Albrechtsberger. While it is generally agreed that Sperger studied double bass under Friedrich Pichlberger, the latter did not arrive in Vienna until 1769. In 1777, Sperger received his first known appointment in Pressburg (now Bratislava) in the Kapelle of Prince Batthyany. The six years that he held this position were his most fruitful as a composer and upon the dissolution of the orchestra, Sperger found a new position in the Kapelle of Count Ludwig Erdödy in Fidisch (Eberau) from 1783-1786. Following the death of the Count, Sperger is not known to have held any orchestral position until 1789, when a seat became available in the court orchestra of Frederick Francis I (then Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin). During this period he embarked on two trips in search of work, the first took him north as far as Ludwigslust and the second trip saw him peddling his virtuosic ability in Italy (Triest-Venice-Parma). Meier speculates that Sperger may have temporarily financed his existence as a copyist. Sperger remained in the service of Frederick Francis I (Ludwigslust) until his death in 1812, upon which he was honoured with a performance of Mozart's Requiem.
